# Data Science      == Overlaps with AI, Machine learning and Deep learning
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# AI -> Machine Learning -> Deep Learning
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Machine Learning  == Achieve AI by systems that can recognize patters in a set of Data
# Deep Learning     == One implementation of machine learning using neural networks

# Three subtypes of machine learning
# - Supervised      == data is already categorized in groups => classification and regression
# - Unsupervised    == uncategorized data => clustering and association rule learing
# - Reinforcement   == teaching machines by trail and error in millions of simulations

import numpy, pandas, sklearn 

# 1 - Import the data
# 2 - Clean the data
# 3 - Split data in Training Set/Test Set
# 4 - Create/Import a Model
# 5 - Check the output
# 6 - Improve
